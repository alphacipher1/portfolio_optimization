# portfolio_optimization
This project builds a long-only portfolio from 20 NASDAQ/NYSE stocks via a reproducible pipeline: ridge-regularized factor filtering to stabilize noisy moments, Markov-chain regime checks, and QP efficient-frontier/tangency selection. Cholesky simulations stress-test weights. On Oct 2020–Oct 2025 data, weights are steadier than naïve mean–variance.
